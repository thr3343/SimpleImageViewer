# SimpleImageViewer

Experiment to test and export use of alternate Rendering techniques and GPU capabilities to render and handle image and bitmap formats.

This is heavily based on the [VkMod2 Repo](https://github.com/thr3343/VkMod2), so may reuse code from there in some places



Currently Requires a Graphics Card/GPU with a basic level of Vulkan 1.1 support 

This repo is highly unfinished and lacks several key features, including directory traversal and resolution scaling (only supports 1080p images), and therefore currently exists as more of a technical experiment playing with bitmap formats with Vulkan than as an actually functional utility
