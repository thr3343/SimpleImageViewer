# SimpleImageViewer

Experimental program/application to test using the Vulkan API in tandem with using Rendering techniques and GPU capabilities instead of more conventional CPU/Scalar-based approaches for Rendering and Handling Images and Bitmap formats.

This also attempts to ascertain and explore possible theories for more efficent methods of decoding, displaying and scaling very large bitmap-based files (e.g. 32k*32K resolutions or larger) which can be very slow using more conventional methods, where techniques and hardware leveraging SIMD principles such as GPUs Vulkan Compute may be more suited for and adequately equipped to handle.
